# Pygrad

A small reverse-mode automatic differentiation (backpropagation) and deep learning library built in Python. 

The library is based on the homework of CMU's Deep Learning Systems course (https://github.com/dlsyscourse). Other resources are listed in the references section.

It supports the computation of scalar-valued functions composed of a limited set of operations on NumPy arrays. 

The included neural networks module allows the user to define and train deep learning models with a simple API that is similar to PyTorch.
